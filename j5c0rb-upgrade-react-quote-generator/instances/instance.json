  "problem_statement": "The current React quote generator displays random quotes but lacks user interactivity and management features. Users cannot mark favorites, search through quotes, remove or undo actions, or persist selections across sessions. The goal is to extend the existing generator to allow users to favorite quotes (with limits and no duplicates), search favorites by text or author, remove quotes with a temporary undo option, and ensure favorites persist in localStorage, all while maintaining the current behavior and using only React and DOM APIs.",
