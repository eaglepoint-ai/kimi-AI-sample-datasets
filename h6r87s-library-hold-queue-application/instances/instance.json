  "problem_statement": "Build a library hold-queue app where users place holds on books and receive copies when they become the first eligible in line. Users can freeze a hold to keep their position but be skipped, and unfreeze to become eligible again. When a copy is returned, the system assigns it to the first non-frozen, unfulfilled hold while keeping positions stable and preventing duplicate holds per user per book. Implement using a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and JSON file storage only.",
