  "problem_statement": "Enhance test coverage for a Go semantic version comparator by writing table-driven unit tests (stdlib only) that verify correct results for equal (0), less-than (-1), and greater-than (1) version comparisons. Tests must cover versions with different component lengths (e.g., \\\"1.0\\\" = \\\"1.0.0\\\"), ignore pre-release suffixes, and handle invalid inputs safely without panicking, while not modifying the existing implementation.",
